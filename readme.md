## Technologies Used

Frontend - React, Axios, Vanilla CSS, Vite

Backend - Django-Rest-Framework, PyJWT

Database - Postgresql

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn Django, familiarize myself with language of Python in web development, and utilize my first ever sql database. This project is meant to be a noobie copy of a booru imageboard, which is essentially just an image hosting website for specific fandoms such as anime and video games. 

## Running

As of currently, the database is hosted on my local machine, therefore only the frontend of the website will work. Apologies for the inconvenience.

## Overview

This website was the most ambitious project as of yet, spanning over a month to complete due to factors of life getting in the way such as school projects and finals. While there are two features that I am extremely proud to say I implemented, the biggest feature I am proud of is pagination. Pagination was a really scary, daunting concept when I first tried writing out how I would implement this in my project, however, Djangos ORM made the implementation extremely easy. JWT authentication is the second feature I am extremely proud to say I implemented, because it managed to add a layer of security that my previous projects lacked. Of course, thats not to say those are the only two interesting take aways of the website, as working with image and file handling in genearal has leveled up my skills in ways I could not have predicted. All in all, this was an amazing website that I hope to comeback to one day, and possibly improve (write it in rust :3).
